            delivery and invoicing addresses while keeping the possibility of
            deleting a Product or modifying the invoicing or delivery address.

            of the Products whose photos are displayed on the Website are

            to the technical limitations of colour reproduction on the

            liable for non-substantial errors or inaccuracies of photographs or
            graphic representations of Products appearing on the Website.

            that he/she/it has been engaged in a fraudulent activity, or for any
            other legitimate reason.

            within a period of 30 days from the maximum estimated time of
            delivery, the Customer shall have the possibility to cancel the said
            order at no cost. The sums that he/she/it will have paid will then
            be reimbursed. In cases where it has the capacity to do so, BAZISZT
            reserves the possibility to offer the Customer a Product of
            equivalent quality and price as the initial product.

            In the situation where BAZISZT is prevented or delayed by a force
            majeure case in honouring its commitments, BAZISZT undertakes to
            inform the Customer within 96 hours by specifying the exact elements
            constituting the force majeure, the reasonably foreseeable period of
            delay or prevention. BAZISZT shall then be exempt from the liability
            in connection with the non-performance or delay in performance of
            its obligations but undertakes to use its best efforts to resume
            full performance without further delay. In such a case of force
            majeure, BAZISZT may exercise its discretionary right to terminate
            the order or any part thereof, without being held liable, except
            however that BAZISZT shall be responsible to reimburse the Customer
            for any amounts already paid. In no event shall the Customer invoke
            a case of force majeure to release himself/herself/itself even
            temporarily from an obligation to pay a sum of money.
